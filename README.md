# ThreeJS & Webpack Starter ![Node v8.9.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-v8.9.0-brightgreen.svg?logo=node.js)

I got tired of the amount of overhead involved in getting a modular THREE.js project up-and-running. This repo is intended to solve some of those problems. I'll keep iterating -- I'd like to include the minimal amount of boilerplate required to stop repeating myself for EVERY project but also be completely unopinionated.

## 🎉 Getting Started

Out-of-the-box, things are pretty simple:

1. 🛠 **Install dependencies.** I use `ci` instead of `i`/`install` to avoid versioning discrepancies but live your life.

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

2. 🏗 **Build project.** There's no watcher task just yet, I'll be adding one soon!

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
